Creating an onClick Event Handler on a button: 

<button
            onClick={event => alert(event.target.id)}
          >
            <span role="img" aria-label="woman dancing" id="woman dancing">💃</span>
 </button>

onClick gets camelCased since its JSX, 
onClick uses an anonymous function to retrieve information about the item 
that was clicked. 

an anonymous function is simply an unnamed function. 

You added an anonymous arrow function that will get the event from the clicked 
button, and the event will have a target that is the <span> element. 

The information you need is in the id attribute, which you can access with event.target.id.
 You can trigger the alert with the alert() function.


-------========-----------============--------------=============------------===========

You can reduce a duplication by declaring the function once and passing it to each 
onClick action. Since the function does not rely on anything other than inputs and 
outputs, you can declare it outside the main component function. 

----> const displayEmojiName = event => alert(event.target.id);   <-------

function App() {
  const greeting = "greeting";
  return(
    <div className="container">
      <h1 id={greeting}>Hello, World</h1>
      <p>I am writing JSX</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <button
      ------>  onClick={displayEmojiName}  <-----------------
          >
            <span role="img" aria-label="grinning face" id="grinning face">😀</span>
          </button>

Step 4 — Mapping Over Data to Create Elements
---------==============---------------===============-------------============----

To use JavaScript inside of JSX, you need to surround it with curly braces: {}. 

To create React components, you’ll need to convert the data to JSX elements. 
To do this, you’ll map over the data and return a JSX element. There are a few 
things you’ll need to keep in mind as you write the code.

First, a group of items needs to be surrounded by a container <div>. 
Second, every item needs a special property called key. 
The key needs to be a unique piece of data that React can use to keep 
track of the elements so it can know when to update the component.
Whenever you are working with loops you will need to add a simple 
string as a key.

Example: 

    ..
const names = [
    "Atul Gawande",
    "Stan Sakai",
    "Barry Lopez"
];

return(
    <div>
        {names.map(name => <div key={name}>{name}</div>)}
    </div>
)
...

Resulting HTML would be: 

...
<div>
    <div>Atul Gawande</div>
    <div>Stan Sakai</div>
    <div>Barry Lopez</div>
</div>
...
